It handles its own security, transaction validation, and consensus without relying on another network. Think of it as the \u0026ldquo;base layer\u0026rdquo; or the highway system upon which everything else is built L1 networks act as the \u0026ldquo;source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the ledger, ensuring decentralization without relying on external systems. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of L1 networks Summary of what L1 networks do# Characteristic Description Examples from Prominent L1 Networks Consensus Mechanism The protocol that enables network participants (nodes) to agree on the state of the blockchain, ensuring security and preventing double-spending. Common types include Proof-of-Work (PoW, energy-intensive mining), Proof-of-Stake (PoS, staking-based validation), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This directly impacts decentralization, energy use, and transaction finality. Bitcoin (PoW), Ethereum (PoS post-Merge), Solana (PoH + PoS hybrid). Security Achieved through cryptographic hashing, distributed node validation, and economic incentives (e.g., slashing stakes for malicious behavior). L1s prioritize immutability and resistance to attacks like 51% attacks. Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s PoS uses staking penalties; Bitcoin relies on massive computational power for PoW security. Scalability Refers to transaction throughput (TPS), block size/time, and handling network congestion. Most L1s face the \u0026ldquo;blockchain trilemma\u0026rdquo; (balancing security, decentralization, and scalability), often achieving 7-100 TPS natively. Solutions like sharding or state channels are integrated at L1 level. Solana (up to 65,000 TPS via Proof-of-History), Ethereum (15-30 TPS, improved via sharding plans). Tokenomics Native tokens used for transaction fees (gas), staking rewards, and governance. Includes supply mechanics (fixed vs. inflationary) and utility in the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC: fixed 21M supply, store-of-value), Ethereum (ETH: used for gas fees and staking). Support for Rollups and L2 Solutions While rollups (e.g., optimistic or zk-rollups) are L2 scaling tools that batch transactions off-chain and settle on L1, strong L1s provide secure data availability and finality for these. This enables higher TPS without compromising L1 security. Ethereum dominates rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism settle on Ethereum); emerging L1s like Polygon (now L1 with zkEVM) natively support rollup-like scaling. Governance Mechanisms for protocol upgrades, often on-chain voting via tokens or off-chain signaling. Affects adaptability to new features. Ethereum (off-chain EIPs + on-chain voting); Tezos (on-chain baking and proposals). Interoperability Ability to communicate with other chains via bridges or standards, crucial for cross-chain DeFi and data transfer.

As of November 2025, AMMs power over $1 trillion in annual trading volume across blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and emerging Layer 2s, enabling permissionless, 24/7 liquidity. This deep dive explores their mechanics, evolution, advantages, pitfalls, security, and future trajectory, drawing on foundational concepts and recent innovations.\nWhat is an AMM?# An AMM is a smart contract protocol that facilitates cryptocurrency trades using algorithmic pricing instead of matching buyers and sellers via order books. Users trade against a liquidity pool—a reserve of token pairs deposited by liquidity providers (LPs) who earn fees from trades. This peer-to-pool model eliminates centralized custodians, reducing counterparty risk and enabling global, instant access.\nAMMs emerged in 2018 with projects like Bancor and Uniswap, addressing the \u0026ldquo;liquidity chicken-and-egg\u0026rdquo; problem in early DEXes. By 2025, they\u0026rsquo;ve matured into sophisticated systems handling everything from stablecoin swaps to perpetual futures, with total value locked (TVL) exceeding $200 billion across ecosystems.\nHow AMMs Work: Core Mechanics# At their heart, AMMs rely on mathematical invariants to determine prices dynamically based on pool balances. The most common is the constant product formula: ( x \\times y = k ), where:\n( x ) = reserve of token A (e.g., ETH), ( y ) = reserve of token B (e.g., USDC), ( k ) = constant product invariant. This hyperbolic curve ensures the pool\u0026rsquo;s total value remains balanced post-trade, with prices adjusting via supply/demand shifts.\nStep-by-Step Trade Example# Consider a pool with 10 ETH (( x )) and 50,000 USDC (( y )), so ( k = 500,000 ). The spot price is ( \\frac{y}{x} = 5,000 ) USDC per ETH.\nUser Sells 1 ETH: New ( x\u0026rsquo; = 11 ) ETH. To maintain ( k ), ( y\u0026rsquo; = \\frac{500,000}{11} \\approx 45,454.55 ) USDC. Output Calculation: User receives ( 50,000 - 45,454.55 = 4,545.45 ) USDC (minus ~0.3% fee). Price Impact: New spot price ≈ 4,132 USDC per ETH—cheaper due to increased ETH supply. LPs deposit equal values of both tokens (e.g., 1 ETH + 5,000 USDC) and receive LP tokens representing their share. They earn 0.05–1% fees per trade, proportional to their stake. Removing liquidity burns LP tokens and returns proportional reserves, but ratios may shift due to trades.\nFees and Incentives: Fees (e.g., Uniswap\u0026rsquo;s tiered 0.01–1%) accrue to LPs. Yield farming—staking LP tokens for extra rewards—boosts participation, though it can lead to over-incentivization.\nTypes of AMMs# AMMs have evolved beyond the basic constant product model to optimize for different assets and risks:\nType Formula/Mechanism Best For Examples Key Trade-Offs Constant Product ( x \\times y = k ) Volatile pairs (e.g., ETH/USDC) Uniswap v2, SushiSwap Simple, but high impermanent loss and slippage. Constant Sum ( x + y = k ) Stablecoins (low volatility) Early stablecoin pools No impermanent loss, but vulnerable to drainage if prices deviate. Hybrid Blends products/sums; weighted pools Multi-asset or stables Curve (stable-optimized), Balancer (custom weights) Flexible, low slippage for similars, but complex math. Concentrated Liquidity Liquidity in price ranges (e.g., ( \\sqrt{P_h} - \\sqrt{P_l} )) Capital-efficient trading Uniswap v3, Orca Higher LP returns, but requires active management. Concentrated models, like Uniswap v3\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;positions,\u0026rdquo; let LPs focus capital in expected price bands, multiplying efficiency by 4,000x in some cases.\nKey Examples in Action# Uniswap: The OG AMM, launched 2018 on Ethereum. v3 (2021) introduced concentrated liquidity; by 2025, it dominates with $100B+ cumulative volume. Governance via UNI token enables fee switches. Curve Finance: Stablecoin specialist using a low-slippage \u0026ldquo;stable swap\u0026rdquo; invariant. CRV token incentivizes LPs; integrated with lending protocols for composability. Balancer: Allows up to 8 tokens per pool with adjustable weights (e.g., 80/20 BTC/ETH). BAL token for governance; excels in index-like funds. PancakeSwap: BSC-based for low fees; features lotteries and NFTs alongside swaps. Recent Innovation: Skate AMM (Launched March 2025): A cross-VM (virtual machine) AMM on Solana, unifying liquidity across EVM, SVM, TonVM, and MoveVM without bridges. It uses intent-based execution and EigenLayer for security, achieving $70M volume in months by slashing slippage in fragmented markets. This \u0026ldquo;stateless DeFi\u0026rdquo; model enables one-click cross-chain swaps, reducing bridge hacks (historically $2.5B lost). On X, recent chatter highlights Skate\u0026rsquo;s role in liquidity unification, with users praising its bridge-free composability for Solana DeFi.\nPros and Cons# AMMs democratize trading but aren\u0026rsquo;t flawless.\nPros# Decentralization \u0026amp; Accessibility: No KYC, global 24/7 access via wallets. Continuous Liquidity: Pools always available, minimizing downtime. Lower Costs: Fees \u0026lt;0.5% vs. CEX spreads; no withdrawal delays. Transparency \u0026amp; Composability: On-chain audits; integrates with lending/flash loans. Incentives: LPs earn yields (5–50% APY via fees/farming). Cons# Impermanent Loss (IL): If ETH doubles vs. USDC, an LP\u0026rsquo;s pool share underperforms holding (e.g., 5.7% IL at 2x divergence). Formula: ( IL = 2\\sqrt{r} / (1 + r) - 1 ), where ( r ) = price ratio. Slippage: Large trades (\u0026gt;1% pool size) cause 5–20% price impact. Front-Running: MEV bots sandwich trades, extracting value. Gas Fees: High on Ethereum; mitigated by L2s. Scenario Hold Value Pool Value IL % Price Ratio = 1x $10,000 $10,000 0% Price Ratio = 2x $15,000 $14,142 -5.7% Price Ratio = 5x $25,000 $22,360 -10.6% Challenges and Limitations (and Solutions)# As DeFi scales, AMMs grapple with systemic issues:\nLiquidity Fragmentation: Siloed chains cause thin pools and poor discovery. Solution: Aggregators like 1inch or cross-chain like Skate AMM pool liquidity virtually. Price Manipulation: Flash loans skew oracles. Solution: TWAP (time-weighted average prices) and Chainlink oracles. Regulatory Hurdles: AML/KYC tensions with pseudonymity. Solution: Privacy tech like ZK-proofs for compliant yet anonymous trades (e.g., Zama\u0026rsquo;s encrypted KYC). Scalability: Congestion spikes fees. Solution: L2 rollups (Arbitrum) and modular designs. Industry responses include hybrid AMM-orderbook DEXes (e.g., EdgeX on X discussions) for precision trading. Recent X posts also spotlight crvUSD\u0026rsquo;s evolution as a revenue-stabilizing stablecoin amid AMM fee drops.\nSecurity Deep Dive: Risks and Mitigations# Constant-product AMMs\u0026rsquo; simplicity breeds vulnerabilities:\nSmart Contract Bugs: Reentrancy (e.g., 2016 DAO hack echoes) or overflow errors. Mitigation: Audits (Peckshield, ConsenSys) and formal verification. Oracle Manipulation: Flash loan pumps skew ( y/x ) prices for loans/liquidations. Mitigation: Decentralized oracles with delay mechanisms. IL as Economic Attack: Not a bug, but exploitable in volatile pairs. Mitigation: Dynamic fees and IL insurance (e.g., Bancor\u0026rsquo;s v2.1). Cross-Chain Risks: Bridges amplify hacks. Skate\u0026rsquo;s EigenLayer AVS uses $2B+ restaked ETH for slashing-proof attestations. By September 2025, audits emphasize modular contracts: separate liquidity, swap, and oracle logic to isolate failures.\nRecent Developments in 2025# Cross-Chain Unification: Skate AMM\u0026rsquo;s launch unified VMs, hitting 40K+ swaps and enabling Solana dApps to tap EVM liquidity seamlessly. Bitcoin DeFi Boom: Testnets like BestInSlot\u0026rsquo;s AMM bring native swaps to BTC L1, teasing BRC-20 explosions. Perp Innovations: Perpetual Protocol\u0026rsquo;s vAMM hits $17M daily volume with 10x leverage, expanding to Solana. Privacy \u0026amp; RegTech: Zama\u0026rsquo;s FHE enables encrypted DAO votes and KYC, drawing institutions. X buzz focuses on AMM vs. orderbook debates, with Solana\u0026rsquo;s Raydium logging $11B DEX volume.\nFuture Trends: AMMs in 2026 and Beyond# By 2026, expect:\nAI-Optimized Pools: Dynamic rebalancing to minimize IL. Unified Liquidity Layers: Stateless intents across 10+ VMs, per Skate\u0026rsquo;s roadmap. TradFi Hybrids: CEX-AMM bridges with tokenized RWAs. Sustainability: Carbon-neutral L2s and fee-burn mechanisms. Mass Adoption: With TVL projected at $500B+, AMMs could capture 20% of global FX volume if regs harmonize. AMMs aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect, but their evolution from simple swaps to cross-chain powerhouses underscores DeFi\u0026rsquo;s resilience. For builders, start with Uniswap forks in Solidity; for traders, aggregate via Jupiter or 1inch. Dive deeper?

Tokenization converts ownership rights into digital tokens, allowing these assets to be used within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield generation.\nRWAs bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with DeFi, bringing real-world value and stability on-chain while leveraging blockchain\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, transparency, and 24/7 accessibility.\nHow RWAs Work in DeFi# Legal Structuring: The asset is held by an off-chain entity (e.g., Special Purpose Vehicle or SPV). Tokenization: Smart contracts mint digital tokens (usually ERC-20 for fractional ownership or ERC-721 for unique assets) representing shares of the underlying asset. Oracles \u0026amp; Data Feeds: Services like Chainlink provide real-time pricing and verification (e.g., Net Asset Value updates). On-Chain Integration: Tokens are used as collateral, for liquidity provision, or yield farming in protocols like Aave, MakerDAO, Centrifuge, or Ondo Finance. Key Benefits# Fractional Ownership: High-value assets become accessible to retail investors. Increased Liquidity: Illiquid assets (e.g., real estate) can be traded globally and instantly. Stable Yields: Exposure to real-world returns (e.g., U.S. Treasuries) reduces reliance on volatile crypto assets. Efficiency: Lower costs and faster settlements compared to traditional markets. Global Access: Borderless participation, especially for underserved regions. Popular Use Cases \u0026amp; Examples# U.S. Treasuries: Ondo Finance (OUSG) tokenizes short-term Treasuries. Real Estate: RealT (property-specific NFTs), Centrifuge (pooled real estate loans). Commodities: Pax Gold (PAXG) backed by physical gold. Private Credit: Goldfinch and Centrifuge for on-chain lending against real-world invoices or loans. Carbon Credits: Toucan Protocol for tokenized environmental assets. Challenges# Regulatory uncertainty around tokenized securities. Reliance on off-chain custodians and oracles (potential centralization risks). Legal and operational complexity in linking on-chain tokens to off-chain assets. How Token Supply and Network Are Defined# Token issuers follow a structured process to ensure integrity:\nLegal Wrapper (SPV/Trust): Defines total asset value and exclusivity (one canonical representation). Token Standard: Often ERC-3643 (permissioned) or ERC-20/721 with role-based minting controlled by the SPV. Supply Mechanism: Minting is tied to audited Net Asset Value (NAV) via oracles; supply = Asset Value ÷ Token Price. Canonical Network: Declared in legal documents (commonly Ethereum, Base, Polygon, or dedicated chains like Centrifuge Chain). Preventing Duplicate Listings of the Same Asset# Multiple mechanisms ensure one asset isn\u0026rsquo;t tokenized multiple times across chains:\nLegal Exclusivity Clauses: SPV agreements prohibit multiple issuances. On-Chain Proof-of-Reserve (PoR): Chainlink or similar verifies custody; mismatches flag duplicates. Unique Identifiers: ERC-3643 ONCHAINID, Centrifuge Pool UUID, or metadata hashes (IPFS + legal document hashes). Public Registries: Platforms like RWA.xyz list canonical tickers and chains. Bridging Controls: Cross-chain versions use \u0026ldquo;lock-and-mint\u0026rdquo; (wrapped tokens), never creating new underlying supply. Outlook# As of late 2025, RWA total value locked has grown significantly, attracting institutional interest. Advances in oracles, standards (e.g., ERC-3643), and regulation are accelerating adoption. RWAs are expected to bring trillions in traditional asset value on-chain, maturing DeFi with greater stability and real-world utility.\nThis page summarizes key concepts in Real World Assets within Decentralized Finance. For the latest developments, refer to protocols like Ondo Finance, Centrifuge, and resources such as RWA.xyz.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/defi_basics/flash_loans/","title":"Flash loans","section":"DeFi Use Cases","content":"Summary of DeFi Flash Loans# Flash loans are a unique feature in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that allow users to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency without any collateral. The catch is that the loan must be repaid (plus a small fee, usually around 0.09%) within the same blockchain transaction—typically in seconds.\nIf repayment doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur, the entire transaction is automatically reversed, making the loan risk-free for the lender. This innovation, popularized by protocols like Aave, enables powerful strategies but also high-risk exploits.\nKey benefits:\nAccess unlimited capital instantly. No upfront funds or credit checks needed. Main uses:\nPrice arbitrage across exchanges. Collateral swaps. Debt refinancing. Risks: Failed transactions waste gas fees, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been used in major attacks by manipulating prices temporarily.\nSimple Example: Arbitrage# Imagine ETH is trading at $2,000 on DEX A but $2,020 on DEX B (a temporary price difference).\nYou take a flash loan of 100 ETH (worth ~$200,000) from Aave—no collateral needed. Buy 100 ETH cheaply on DEX A using the loaned funds. No, wait: actually, to arbitrage, you borrow stablecoins, say USDC. Better simple version:\nBorrow $1 million USDC via flash loan. Swap the $1M USDC for ETH on DEX A (where ETH is cheaper). Immediately swap that ETH back to USDC on DEX B (where ETH is more expensive). Repay the $1M USDC + tiny fee to Aave. Keep the profit (e.g., $10,000 difference). All this happens in one transaction. If prices align and no profit (or loss), it reverts safely.\nFlash loans democratize high-finance strategies but highlight DeFi\u0026rsquo;s wild, permissionless nature!\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/defi_basics/pools_farming/","title":"Pools and Pool Farming","section":"DeFi Use Cases","content":" Pools# Pools are a little bit like the pot in Poker You lock player\u0026rsquo;s money in a pot (pool) and you play it The same is with Polymarket and Fantasy football—you lock the money, and you wait for things to happen, and when they happen, you let the rules of the game (contracts) distribute the pot In the case of DeFi, we are dealing with pools of tokens (ETH, DAI, USDC, etc.) Pool Farming# In De-Fi, pool farming is a form of passive income—meaning you put your money somewhere, and it gives you returns Specifically - much like with airport currency exchanges—you can lock your money in a digital currency trading pool (ran by someone else), and they will pay you a fee each time a transaction is made In this case you act as a liquidity provider This is really important to understand…in real finance, only financial institutions (mostly big banks or governments) are as liquidity providers In De-Fi it can be anyone "},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/blockchain/intro_and_concepts/","title":"Intro and Concepts","section":"Blockchain","content":"Blockchain Basics: Intro and Concepts# We will start with simple examples to introduce the technology and the way it works Then we\u0026rsquo;ll explain what the important concepts are – what makes the technology so powerful \u0026hellip;and only then we\u0026rsquo;ll get into complex stuff required to understand what goes on under the hood Consider an example: You have a regular account in a bank (like Chase) and Venmo app. A friend is asking you to pay him in Bitcoin.

By using complex math algorithms and cryptography, miners ensure the blockchain functions as a reliable financial system, producing a currency that is defined by several key traits enabled by this technology: Feature Blockchain Implementation Scarcity It is very hard to create new coins. Transparency All transactions are visible to everyone. Tamper-Proof It is nearly impossible to create fake coins or transactions. Immutability The transaction history cannot be overwritten. Decentralization The currency is not controlled by any single entity or government.

Evan receives his 3 Bitcoins, and the record becomes immutable.\nRewards and Repetition# Block Reward: The winning miner currently receives ~3.125 Bitcoins (this \u0026ldquo;halves\u0026rdquo; every four years).\nFees: Miners also collect small transaction fees paid by users like Mark.\nSupply Cap: This system ensures that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, preventing uncontrolled inflation.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/smart_contracts/polymarket/","title":"Polymarket","section":"Smart Contracts","content":"Another example – Polymarket# Polymarket is a prediction markets defi app created using smart contracts It is effectively a betting app – you place a bet on an event There are other prediction markets apps (Kalshi, for instance), and they are just an example of how easy it is to get a multi-billion business working in De-FI Smart Contracts in Prediction Markets (e.g., Polymarket)# Bet Placement:# Smart contract creates a market for \u0026ldquo;Washington Capitals winning Stanley Cup?\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Yes/No\u0026rdquo; outcome tokens Bettors deposit crypto (e.g., USDC) to buy \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; shares at market price (e.g., $0.40 = 40% chance), locking funds trustlessly in the contract—no intermediary needed.
