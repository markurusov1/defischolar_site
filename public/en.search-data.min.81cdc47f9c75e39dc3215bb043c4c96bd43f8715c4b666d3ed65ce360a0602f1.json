Currencies and Trust# A traditional currency, like the US dollar, only works because people trust that other people will buy/sell stuff for dollars and that the US government won’t just start printing dollars When cryptocurrency started (bitcoin first), not very many people were willing to buy/sell stuff for it. Banks wouldn’t give you dollars for it, so it was just a belief that at some point in the future the acceptance and trust will grow…which has (kind of) happened The reason people trust gold is that everyone believes it will be accepted as currency forever – because it cannot be manufactured at will or faked Gold is still the second-best thing to just trading things (one horse for 10 sheep) directly, known as barter Real Gold and Digital Gold# When people say “bitcoin is a digital gold,” they mean that: There is a limited amount of it, or it is tough to create/find Governments have no control on the creation of bitcoin or gold Which is “almost” true It has only as much value as people believe it has. Things like gold and diamonds are largely useless, but they are believed to be valuable forever. Same with Bitcoin and - increasingly - other cryptocurrencies Types of Currencies# Before we dive deeper into how the blockchain works… There are three types of currencies: Fiat currencies – dollars, pounds, euros-are issued by the governments Stable cryptocurrencies – these are “pegged” to Fiat currencies, meaning that for every digital coin there is a dollar (this is known as “backed by fiat”) Other cryptocurrencies, not backed by anything at all (Bitcoin is one of them) Remember that a cryptocurrency is really just a token generated by a blockchain network You can create your own network with your own tokens – that would be your own cryptocurrency There are tons of trust issues around all of this "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/networks/","title":"Blockchain Networks","section":"Docs","content":"Layer 1 (L1) Networks: The Foundational Layer# A Layer 1 (L1) blockchain is a foundational network that operates independently. It handles its own security, transaction validation, and consensus without relying on another network. Think of it as the \u0026ldquo;base layer\u0026rdquo; or the highway system upon which everything else is built L1 networks act as the \u0026ldquo;source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the ledger, ensuring decentralization without relying on external systems. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of L1 networks Summary of what L1 networks do# Characteristic Description Examples from Prominent L1 Networks Consensus Mechanism The protocol that enables network participants (nodes) to agree on the state of the blockchain, ensuring security and preventing double-spending. Common types include Proof-of-Work (PoW, energy-intensive mining), Proof-of-Stake (PoS, staking-based validation), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This directly impacts decentralization, energy use, and transaction finality. Bitcoin (PoW), Ethereum (PoS post-Merge), Solana (PoH + PoS hybrid). Security Achieved through cryptographic hashing, distributed node validation, and economic incentives (e.g., slashing stakes for malicious behavior). L1s prioritize immutability and resistance to attacks like 51% attacks. Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s PoS uses staking penalties; Bitcoin relies on massive computational power for PoW security. Scalability Refers to transaction throughput (TPS), block size/time, and handling network congestion. Most L1s face the \u0026ldquo;blockchain trilemma\u0026rdquo; (balancing security, decentralization, and scalability), often achieving 7-100 TPS natively. Solutions like sharding or state channels are integrated at L1 level. Solana (up to 65,000 TPS via Proof-of-History), Ethereum (15-30 TPS, improved via sharding plans). Tokenomics Native tokens used for transaction fees (gas), staking rewards, and governance. Includes supply mechanics (fixed vs. inflationary) and utility in the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC: fixed 21M supply, store-of-value), Ethereum (ETH: used for gas fees and staking). Support for Rollups and L2 Solutions While rollups (e.g., optimistic or zk-rollups) are L2 scaling tools that batch transactions off-chain and settle on L1, strong L1s provide secure data availability and finality for these. This enables higher TPS without compromising L1 security. Ethereum dominates rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism settle on Ethereum); emerging L1s like Polygon (now L1 with zkEVM) natively support rollup-like scaling. Governance Mechanisms for protocol upgrades, often on-chain voting via tokens or off-chain signaling. Affects adaptability to new features. Ethereum (off-chain EIPs + on-chain voting); Tezos (on-chain baking and proposals). Interoperability Ability to communicate with other chains via bridges or standards, crucial for cross-chain DeFi and data transfer. Cosmos (IBC protocol for sovereign chains); Polkadot (parachains for shared security). The Top 15 Networks by Total Value Locked (TVL)# **Total Value Locked (TVL)** is a key metric in DeFi. It represents the total amount of assets (tokens)\rcurrently being used within a network's smart contracts for things like lending or trading. A higher TVL often indicates more trust and utility. Rank Network Key Characteristic 1 Ethereum The pioneer of smart contracts; largest ecosystem. 2 Tron High speed, popular for stablecoin transfers. 3 Solana Focused on extreme speed and low costs. 4 BSC (BNB) High transaction volume, supported by Binance. 5 Arbitrum (L2*) Leading Ethereum scaling solution. 6 Avalanche Fast finality and highly interoperable. 7 Polygon Multi-chain system connected to Ethereum. 8 Base Coinbase\u0026rsquo;s consumer-focused network. 9 Sui High-performance, object-centric design. 10 Optimism Scalability focused on \u0026ldquo;Optimistic Rollups.\u0026rdquo; 11 Near Climate-neutral and developer-friendly. 12 Cronos Crypto.com’s EVM-compatible chain. 13 Bitcoin The original \u0026ldquo;Digital Gold\u0026rdquo;; now adding DeFi layers. 14 Gnosis Community-run network for security and efficiency. 15 TON Deeply integrated with the Telegram app. Comparing the Big Three# Each network makes different trade-offs in its architecture:\nBitcoin (The Store of Value): Focused on maximum security and decentralization. It is slow (7 transactions per second) but serves as the world’s most secure ledger. Ethereum (The World Computer): The leader in programmability. While it can be expensive and slower than newer chains, it is the most trusted for complex financial applications. Solana (The Speed King): Built for mass adoption. It can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second with fees under a penny, making it ideal for gaming and high-frequency trading. The Blockchain Trilemma# No blockchain is perfect. Developers must balance three competing priorities:\nDecentralization: The network is run by many people/computers. Security: The network is impossible to hack or corrupt. Scalability: The network stays fast and cheap as more people use it. Improving one often means sacrificing another. For example, Solana achieves high scalability but is often criticized for being less decentralized than Bitcoin.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/blockchain/intro_and_concepts/","title":"Intro and Concepts","section":"Blockchain","content":"Blockchain Basics: Intro and Concepts# We will start with simple examples to introduce the technology and the way it works Then we\u0026rsquo;ll explain what the important concepts are – what makes the technology so powerful \u0026hellip;and only then we\u0026rsquo;ll get into complex stuff required to understand what goes on under the hood Example# You have a regular account in a bank (like Chase) and Venmo app A friend is asking you to pay him in Bitcoin How would this work? Wallets# Remember how Bitcoin is a network? All the kids with their Venmo apps are now nodes in that network Specifically, these nodes are known as digital wallets Wallets are a lot like bank accounts You keep your money (digital currency, tokens) in them You send/receive tokens from/into them The network knows the wallets by their IDs (just a long text string) A Word on Exchanges# In real markets and cryptocurrency markets, exchanges are companies that perform buying and selling of stocks or currencies If you saw a \u0026ldquo;Currency Exchange\u0026rdquo; kiosk at an airport – that\u0026rsquo;s a little exchange It holds cash in many currencies It buys currency from you at a lower rate and then sells it to someone else at a higher rate and makes profit Stock markets do this as well, just at a much higher scale Buying Bitcoin into Venmo# Venmo holds your wallet and Venmo is connected to your bank account Venmo also acts as an exchange broker The first thing you do in the app is press \u0026ldquo;Buy Crypto\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip;and then Venmo will Connect to one of many exchanges operating in the Bitcoin network (Paxos) Conduct the transaction on your behalf Find another wallet (through an exchange) that transfers its Bitcoins to your wallet Take some dollars from your bank account and send to that exchange (which will later send it to whoever sold bitcoins to you) As Grok, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick note: When you buy crypto on Venmo, it\u0026rsquo;s seamless but remember, fees apply, and it\u0026rsquo;s custodial—Venmo holds the keys. For true decentralization, consider non-custodial wallets!\nCan It Be Done Differently?# Yes, it can When cryptocurrencies just started, people used USB-sticks with their digital wallets and had to know their counterparties (people to sell to or buy from) Knowing a counterparty is knowing their wallet’s network address This was a pure peer-to-peer setup – no exchanges, no banks It guaranteed anonymity, which is helpful for all kinds of shady activity The only thing that was public is that a wallet with ID1 moved some coins to a wallet with ID2 This option is still available, but most people use bank-linked apps and trade through exchanges – because it is much easier than going hard-core Digital wallets managed by services like Venmo or other digital currency exchanges are called “custodial” wallets – meaning someone has custody of your stuff Summary# Blockchain is a P2P network technology Bitcoin is just one of many blockchain networks Nodes are digital wallets In the “pure” model, it is a decentralized anonymous system In reality, most people use centrally owned services (banks, apps, exchanges) to transact in Bitcoin "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/blockchain/miners_and_ledger/","title":"Miners and Ledger","section":"Blockchain","content":"Blockchain Step-by-Step: Miners and Ledgers# Miners: The Network\u0026rsquo;s Engine# Beyond digital wallets, the blockchain relies on a critical type of node called a miner.
