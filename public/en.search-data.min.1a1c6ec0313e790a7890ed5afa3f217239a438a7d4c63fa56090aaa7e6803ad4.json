Currencies and Trust# A traditional currency, like the US dollar, only works because people trust that other people will buy/sell stuff for dollars and that the US government won’t just start printing dollars When cryptocurrency started (bitcoin first), not very many people were willing to buy/sell stuff for it. Banks wouldn’t give you dollars for it, so it was just a belief that at some point in the future the acceptance and trust will grow…which has (kind of) happened The reason people trust gold is that everyone believes it will be accepted as currency forever – because it cannot be manufactured at will or faked Gold is still the second-best thing to just trading things (one horse for 10 sheep) directly, known as barter Real Gold and Digital Gold# When people say “bitcoin is a digital gold,” they mean that: There is a limited amount of it, or it is tough to create/find Governments have no control on the creation of bitcoin or gold Which is “almost” true It has only as much value as people believe it has. Things like gold and diamonds are largely useless, but they are believed to be valuable forever. Same with Bitcoin and - increasingly - other cryptocurrencies Types of Currencies# Before we dive deeper into how the blockchain works… There are three types of currencies: Fiat currencies – dollars, pounds, euros-are issued by the governments Stable cryptocurrencies – these are “pegged” to Fiat currencies, meaning that for every digital coin there is a dollar (this is known as “backed by fiat”) Other cryptocurrencies, not backed by anything at all (Bitcoin is one of them) Remember that a cryptocurrency is really just a token generated by a blockchain network You can create your own network with your own tokens – that would be your own cryptocurrency There are tons of trust issues around all of this "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/networks/","title":"Blockchain Networks","section":"Docs","content":"Layer 1 (L1) Networks# A Layer 1 (L1) blockchain is a foundational network that operates independently. It handles its own security, transaction validation, and consensus without relying on another network. Think of it as the \u0026ldquo;base layer\u0026rdquo; or the highway system upon which everything else is built L1 networks act as the \u0026ldquo;source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the ledger, ensuring decentralization without relying on external systems. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are built on top of L1 networks Summary of what L1 networks do# Characteristic Description Examples from Prominent L1 Networks Consensus Mechanism The protocol that enables network participants (nodes) to agree on the state of the blockchain, ensuring security and preventing double-spending. Common types include Proof-of-Work (PoW, energy-intensive mining), Proof-of-Stake (PoS, staking-based validation), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This directly impacts decentralization, energy use, and transaction finality. Bitcoin (PoW), Ethereum (PoS post-Merge), Solana (PoH + PoS hybrid). Security Achieved through cryptographic hashing, distributed node validation, and economic incentives (e.g., slashing stakes for malicious behavior). L1s prioritize immutability and resistance to attacks like 51% attacks. Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s PoS uses staking penalties; Bitcoin relies on massive computational power for PoW security. Scalability Refers to transaction throughput (TPS), block size/time, and handling network congestion. Most L1s face the \u0026ldquo;blockchain trilemma\u0026rdquo; (balancing security, decentralization, and scalability), often achieving 7-100 TPS natively. Solutions like sharding or state channels are integrated at L1 level. Solana (up to 65,000 TPS via Proof-of-History), Ethereum (15-30 TPS, improved via sharding plans). Tokenomics Native tokens used for transaction fees (gas), staking rewards, and governance. Includes supply mechanics (fixed vs. inflationary) and utility in the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC: fixed 21M supply, store-of-value), Ethereum (ETH: used for gas fees and staking). Support for Rollups and L2 Solutions While rollups (e.g., optimistic or zk-rollups) are L2 scaling tools that batch transactions off-chain and settle on L1, strong L1s provide secure data availability and finality for these. This enables higher TPS without compromising L1 security. Ethereum dominates rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism settle on Ethereum); emerging L1s like Polygon (now L1 with zkEVM) natively support rollup-like scaling. Governance Mechanisms for protocol upgrades, often on-chain voting via tokens or off-chain signaling. Affects adaptability to new features. Ethereum (off-chain EIPs + on-chain voting); Tezos (on-chain baking and proposals). Interoperability Ability to communicate with other chains via bridges or standards, crucial for cross-chain DeFi and data transfer. Cosmos (IBC protocol for sovereign chains); Polkadot (parachains for shared security).

While it can be expensive and slower than newer chains, it is the most trusted for complex financial applications. Solana (The Speed King): Built for mass adoption. It can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second with fees under a penny, making it ideal for gaming and high-frequency trading. The Blockchain Trilemma# No blockchain is perfect. Developers must balance three competing priorities:\nDecentralization: The network is run by many people/computers. Security: The network is impossible to hack or corrupt. Scalability: The network stays fast and cheap as more people use it. Improving one often means sacrificing another.
