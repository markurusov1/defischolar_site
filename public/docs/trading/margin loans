## Margin Loans

Margin loans allow traders to borrow assets against collateral to increase their position size (leverage). In DeFi, these loans are provided through decentralized lending protocols using smart contracts.
Traders deposit collateral (e.g., ETH) and borrow another asset (e.g., USDC) to trade with leverage (2x, 5x, 10x, etc.).
## How Margin Loans Work

- **Collateral Deposit:**
Deposit assets into a lending protocol. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio determines the maximum borrow amount (e.g., 75% LTV means 100 collateral allows borrowing 75).
- **Borrowing:**
Select the asset and amount to borrow. Interest accrues continuously based on supply and demand.
- **Leveraged Trading:**
Use borrowed funds to open larger positions in spot, perpetuals, or options markets.
- **Health Factor / Collateral Ratio:**
The protocol monitors the collateral-to-debt ratio. If it falls below a threshold (e.g., 150%), the position becomes eligible for liquidation.
- **Liquidation:**
If undercollateralized, the collateral is sold to repay the loan. Liquidators usually receive a fee.

## Key Metrics

- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Maximum borrow amount relative to collateral.
- **Liquidation Threshold:** Collateral ratio below which liquidation occurs.
- **Interest Rates:** Variable rates determined by utilization (borrowed vs. available liquidity).

## Benefits

- **Amplified returns** — Leverage magnifies gains.
- **Capital efficiency** — Trade larger positions with less capital.
- **No credit checks** — Permissionless and instant.

## Risks

- **Liquidation risk** — Volatility can trigger forced sales.
- **Interest costs** — Rates can spike during high demand.
- **Market manipulation** — Oracle price feeds must be reliable.

## Best Practices

- Maintain a high collateral ratio (e.g., 200%+).
- Use stop-loss orders to manage risk.
- Monitor positions during volatile periods.
- Borrow conservatively and understand liquidation mechanics.

Margin loans enable leveraged trading in a decentralized manner but require careful risk management.
