## What is Market Making?
Market making is a crucial strategy in DeFi trading where participants provide liquidity to markets by continuously quoting buy and sell prices for assets. On our platform, market makers help ensure smooth trading by narrowing bid-ask spreads, reducing volatility, and enabling instant executions for other users.
In contrast to traditional finance, DeFi market making is permissionless—anyone can participate by depositing assets into liquidity pools or order books, earning fees from trades that use their liquidity.

## Types of Market Making in DeFi

- **Passive (AMM-based):**
Users deposit equal values of two assets into a liquidity pool (e.g., ETH/USDC). The pool automatically sets prices using a formula (e.g., constant product: x × y = k). Market makers earn a share of trading fees.
- **Active (Order Book-based):**
Traders place limit orders on both sides of the order book and adjust them dynamically based on market conditions. This requires more active management but can offer tighter spreads.
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
Some protocols combine AMM pools with order book features for better efficiency.

## How Market Makers Earn Profits

- **Bid-Ask Spread:** Profit from the difference between buy and sell prices.
- **Trading Fees:** Earn a portion of fees from trades that use their liquidity.
- **Incentives:** Many DeFi platforms offer token rewards for liquidity provision.

## Risks

- **Impermanent Loss (IL):** In AMM pools, price changes can cause losses compared to simply holding the assets.
- **Inventory Risk:** Holding unbalanced positions during volatile markets.
- **Adverse Selection:**  Being "picked off" by informed traders.

## Best Practices

- Use hedging strategies to mitigate IL.
- Monitor market conditions and rebalance positions.
- Diversify across multiple pools or pairs.
- Start with low-risk, high-volume pairs.

Market making is essential for deep liquidity and efficient price discovery in DeFi markets.
