Let&#39;s get started! The Journey# I started this project out of interest in Finance as a future college major. DeFi seemed to be much more accessible, yet there was a lot to learn. As a high schooler myself, I wanted to create a resource that would make DeFi easier to understand for other high schoolers. Thus, DeFi Scholar was born.
The Project# To stay practical, I decided to create (code) an actual DeFi application, centered on Uniswap V4 protocol. This site contains the notes I took along the way, organized into the sections below.

<h2 id="introduction-what-why-and-how">Introduction: What, Why, and How<a class="anchor" href="#introduction-what-why-and-how">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: DeFi (Decentralized Finance) represents the programmable future of money where traditional financial
barriers are replaced by transparent, efficient, and open systems. For aspiring finance majors, understanding this
shift is essential as the industry moves away from central authorities toward peer-to-peer networks.</p>

<div class="book-card"><div class="markdown-inner">
<h2 id="currencies-and-trust">Currencies and Trust<a class="anchor" href="#currencies-and-trust">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Explore the three types of digital value: Fiat-issued currencies, stablecoins pegged to traditional
money, and unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Understand why Bitcoin is often called &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; due to its limited supply and the shift from trusting governments to trusting math and code.</p>

<h2 id="basic-terminology--networks">Basic Terminology &amp; Networks<a class="anchor" href="#basic-terminology--networks">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: At its core, DeFi relies on blockchain technology—a decentralized network of &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; (computers or
people) that operate without a central authority. This section introduces key concepts like tokens (Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins), P2P (peer-to-peer) interactions, and the cryptographic algorithms that make these systems secure.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: A deep dive into how transactions actually move through a distributed, immutable ledger. Learn about the
role of miners who verify transactions, the &ldquo;Proof of Work&rdquo; puzzles that prevent cheating, and how the network
reaches consensus to ensure every digital dollar is accounted for without a bank&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="blockchain-networks">Blockchain networks<a class="anchor" href="#blockchain-networks">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Not all blockchains are the same. This section compares the &ldquo;Top 15&rdquo; foundational L1 networks, including
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. It breaks down their differences in speed (TPS), security models, and &ldquo;Total Value Locked&rdquo; (TVL)—the metric that shows where the most business is actually happening.</p>

<h3 id="smart-contracts">Smart contracts<a class="anchor" href="#smart-contracts">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically move tokens when specific conditions are
met, requiring no middleman or manual oversight. Examples include fantasy football pools and prediction markets like Polymarket, where code guarantees payouts based on real-world data.</p>

<h3 id="exchanges-pools-and-liquidity">Exchanges, Pools and Liquidity<a class="anchor" href="#exchanges-pools-and-liquidity">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Learn how money is made in DeFi through liquidity provision. Unlike traditional finance where only big
banks provide liquidity, DeFi allows anyone to &ldquo;farm&rdquo; pools by locking their tokens to facilitate trades in exchange for a portion of the transaction fees.</p>
