## Networks 
{{% hint success %}} 
- A lot of material is going to be about networks
- In the blockchain/de-fi world a network is either a bunch of computers – proper servers, but also phones and
   tables and such or a bunch of people who use these computers to trade, mine, bet and such
- These people or computers are referred to as “nodes”

## Blockchain 
{{% hint info %}}
- Blockchain is the name of technology - computer programs executing a bunch of well-known algorithms 
- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana are different networks that use Blockchain 
- Each of these networks uses a specific token – Bitcoin is a token, the NFTs, mem coins, stablecoins - all these 
things are tokens 
- Some algorithms have to with cryptography, which is why people refer to blockchain tokens as 
“cryptocurrency” or just “crypto”

## P2P (peer to peer) and “De” in DeFi 
{{% hint success %}}
- Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network; all peers are equals – they have the same rights on the network 
- No central authority = DEcentralized network 
- This is where the “De” in De-Fi coming from

## The "FI" in DeFi 
{{% hint info %}}
- The networks we just mentioned allow people to create apps that use tokens to do “proper” finance activities – running exchanges, trading, lending, earning fees and such – hence “Fi” in De-Fi
- So you now have a decentralized network of equal peers 
- Anyone can create an app and anyone can use apps 
- Which is really why the opportunities of De-Fi are limitless

## Basic finance concepts
- Given that De-Fi is still about finance, there are a few finance concepts you need to understand for now
- They are: __exchange, liquidity and pool__
- De-Fi deals with payments, loans, interest fees, trades and such - and you’d eventually need to get fluent with those

## Exchange
- Take a “Currency Exchange” kiosk at any airport - it buys and sells currency
- You can buy 77 pounds for 100 dollars (1.3 exchange sell rate)
- Or you can buy 96 dollars for 77 pounds (1.25 exchange buy rate)
- The difference between the rates is called “spread” and this is how exchanges make money

```
* Bob came and gave the Exchange $100. Exchange has given Bob 77 pounds
* John then came and gave the exchange 77 pounds. Exchange has given John $96
* Exchange just made $4 and kept its 77 pounds
* Stock exchanges and all other exchanges work the same way
