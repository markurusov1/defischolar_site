- A lot of material is going to be about networks
- In the blockchain/de-fi world a network is either a bunch of computers – proper servers, but also phones and
   tables and such or a bunch of people who use these computers to trade, mine, bet and such
- These people or computers are referred to as “nodes”

## The "FI" in DeFi
{{% hint info %}}
- The networks we just mentioned allow people to create apps that use tokens to do “proper” finance activities – running exchanges, trading, lending, earning fees and such – hence “Fi” in De-Fi
- So you now have a decentralized network of equal peers 
- Anyone can create an app and anyone can use apps 
- Which is really why the opportunities of De-Fi are limitless
