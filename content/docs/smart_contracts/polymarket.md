## Smart Contracts in Prediction Markets (e.g., Polymarket)
{{% hint success %}}
### __Bet Placement:__
- Smart contract creates a market for "Washington Capitals winning Stanley Cup?" with "Yes/No" outcome tokens
- Bettors deposit crypto (e.g., USDC) to buy "Yes" shares at market price (e.g., $0.40 = 40% chance), locking funds 
  trustlessly in the contract—no intermediary needed.
### __Outcome Resolution:__
- Oracle (e.g., Chainlink/UMA) feeds an official NHL result to contract;
- if Caps win, "Yes" = $1 (auto-redeem), "No" = $0—verifiable, tamper-proof data triggers resolution instantly.
### __Automatic Payouts:__
- Contract calculates and sends winnings directly to winners' wallets (e.g., $0.60 profit per $1 bet on "Yes"); full 
  transparency on-chain, no disputes or delays
