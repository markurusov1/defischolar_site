## Basic finance concepts
- Given that De-Fi is still about finance, there are a few finance concepts you need to understand for now 
- They are: __exchange, liquidity and pool__
- De-Fi deals with payments, loans, interest fees, trades and such - and you’d eventually need to get fluent with those

## Exchange
- Take a “Currency Exchange” kiosk at any airport - it buys and sells currency 
- You can buy 77 pounds for 100 dollars (1.3 exchange sell rate)
- Or you can buy 96 dollars for 77 pounds (1.25 exchange buy rate)
- The difference between the rates is called “spread” and this is how exchanges make money

```
* Bob came and gave the Exchange $100. Exchange has given Bob 77 pounds
* John then came and gave the exchange 77 pounds. Exchange has given John $96
* Exchange just made $4 and kept its 77 pounds
* Stock exchanges and all other exchanges work the same way
