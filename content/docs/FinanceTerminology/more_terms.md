## Pools
- Pools are a little bit like the pot in Poker 
- You lock player's money in a pot (pool) and you play it 
- The same is with Polymarket and Fantasy football—you lock the money, and you wait for things to happen, and when 
  they happen, you let the rules of the game (contracts) distribute the pot
- In the case of DeFi, we are dealing with pools of tokens (ETH, DAI, USDC, etc.)

## Pool Farming
- In De-Fi, pool farming is a form of passive income—meaning you put your money somewhere, and it gives you returns 
- Specifically - much like with airport currency exchanges—you can lock your money in a digital currency trading 
  pool (ran by someone else), and they will pay you a fee each time a transaction is made
- In this case you act as a liquidity provider 
- This is really important to understand…in real finance, only financial institutions (mostly big banks or governments) are as liquidity providers 
- In De-Fi it can be anyone
