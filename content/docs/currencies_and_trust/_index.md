## Currency and Money
{{% hint success %}}
- One year of attending Columbia University is worth
  - three Honda Accords
  - Or $90K (USD)
  - Or 40 oz of gold
  - Or 0.81 Bitcoin
- USD, Gold and Bitcoin are currencies, used to make it easy to compare the value of things
- One of the important things about currencies is how much trust people have in them – can they be faked? can they be taken away? can they one day be worth nothing?

## Currencies and Trust
{{% hint info %}}
- A traditional currency, like the US dollar, only works because people trust that other people will buy/sell stuff for dollars and that the US government won’t just start printing dollars
- When cryptocurrency started (bitcoin first), not very many people were willing to buy/sell stuff for it. Banks 
  wouldn’t give you dollars for it, so it was just a belief that at some point in the future the acceptance and 
  trust will grow…which has (kind of) happened
- The reason people trust gold is that everyone believes it will be accepted as currency forever – because it cannot 
  be manufactured at will or faked  
- Gold is still the second-best thing to just trading things (one horse for 10 sheep) directly, known as barter

## Real Gold and Digital Gold
- When people say “bitcoin is a digital gold,” they mean that:
- There is a limited amount of it, or it is tough to create/find
- Governments have no control on the creation of bitcoin or gold
    - Which is “almost” true
- It has only as much value as people believe it has.
- Things like gold and diamonds are largely useless, but they are believed to be valuable forever.
- Same with Bitcoin and - increasingly - other cryptocurrencies

## Types of Currencies
{{% hint warning %}}
- Before we dive deeper into how the blockchain works…
- There are three types of currencies:
    - Fiat currencies – dollars, pounds, euros-are issued by the governments
    - Stable cryptocurrencies – these are “pegged” to Fiat currencies, meaning that for every digital coin there is a dollar (this is known as “backed by fiat”)
    - Other cryptocurrencies, not backed by anything at all (Bitcoin is one of them)
- Remember that a cryptocurrency is really just a token generated by a blockchain network
- You can create your own network with your own tokens – that would be your own cryptocurrency
- There are tons of trust issues around all of this
