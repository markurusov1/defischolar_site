# Currencies

## Currency and Money

- One year at Columbia is three Honda Accords
    - Or $90K
    - Or 40 oz of gold
    - Or 0.81 Bitcoin
- USD, Gold and Bitcoin are currencies, used to make it easy to compare value of things
- One of the important things about currencies is how much trust people have in them - can they be faked? can they be taken away? can they one day be worth nothing?

## Currencies and Trust

1. Traditional currency, like the US dollar, only works because people trust that
   a. other people will buy/sell stuff for dollars and
   b. that the US government won’t just start printing dollars
2. When cryptocurrency started (bitcoin first), not very many people were willing to buy/sell stuff for it. Banks wouldn’t give you dollars for it, so it was just a belief that at some point in the future the acceptance and trust will grow
   a. …which did happen
3. The reason people trust gold is that everyone believes it will be accepted as currency forever – because it cannot be created or faked
4. Gold is still the second-best thing to just trading things (one horse for 10 sheep) directly

## Real Gold and Digital Gold

- When people say “bitcoin is a digital gold,” they mean that:
- There is a limited amount of it, or it is tough to create/find
- Governments have no control on the creation of bitcoin or gold
    - Which is “almost” true
- It has only as much value as people believe it has.
- Things like gold and diamonds are largely useless, but they are believed to be valuable forever.
- Same with Bitcoin and - increasingly - other cryptocurrencies

## Types of Currencies

- Before we dive deeper into how the blockchain works…
- There are three types of currencies:
    - Fiat currencies – dollars, pounds, euros - issued by the governments
    - Stable cryptocurrencies – these are “pegged” to Fiat currencies, meaning that for every digital coin there is a dollar (this is known as “backed by fiat”)
    - Other cryptocurrencies, not backed by anything at all (Bitcoin is one of them)
- Remember that a cryptocurrency is really just a token generated by a blockchain network
- You can create your own network, generate tokens in it and it would be a cryptocurrency
- There are tons of trust issues around all of this
