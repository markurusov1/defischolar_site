## Comparing the Big Three
{{% hint info %}}
Each network makes different trade-offs in its architecture:

1. **Bitcoin (The Store of Value)**: Focused on maximum security and decentralization. It is slow (7 transactions per 
second) but serves as the world’s most secure ledger.
2. **Ethereum (The World Computer)**: The leader in programmability. While it can be expensive and slower than newer 
   chains, it is the most trusted for complex financial applications.
3. **Solana (The Speed King)**: Built for mass adoption. It can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second with fees 
   under a penny, making it ideal for gaming and high-frequency trading.

## The Blockchain Trilemma
{{% hint success %}}
No blockchain is perfect. Developers must balance three competing priorities:
* **Decentralization**: The network is run by many people/computers.
* **Security**: The network is impossible to hack or corrupt.
* **Scalability**: The network stays fast and cheap as more people use it.

> Improving one often means sacrificing another. For example, Solana achieves high **scalability** but is often 
> criticized for being less **decentralized** than Bitcoin.
