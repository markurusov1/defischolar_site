# Blockchain Step-by-Step: Miners and Ledgers

## Miners: The Network's Engine

Beyond digital wallets, the blockchain relies on a critical type of node called a **miner**. Miners are individuals or corporations that run massive server farms—similar to the infrastructure used for Generative AI—which require significant energy to operate.

Miners perform three essential roles:

- **Minting**: They create new units of currency (e.g., Bitcoins)
- **Verification**: They confirm the movement of tokens from one wallet to another
- **Maintenance**: They update and maintain the record of all transactions

## The Distributed Ledger
{{% hint info %}}
- In traditional finance, banks maintain private paperwork to track your balance; in blockchain, this is replaced by 
a **Distributed Ledger**.
- **Transparency**: Everyone on the network can see all transactions.
- **Immutability**: The technology ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it is "immutable"—it cannot be hacked,
  changed, or overridden.

## What Makes a "Good" Currency?

By using complex math algorithms and cryptography, miners ensure the blockchain functions as a reliable financial system. A "good" currency is defined by several key traits enabled by this technology:

| Feature | Blockchain Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Scarcity** | It is very hard to create new coins.|
| **Transparency** | All transactions are visible to everyone.|
| **Tamper-Proof** | It is nearly impossible to create fake coins or transactions.|
| **Immutability** | The transaction history cannot be overwritten.|
| **Decentralization** | The currency is not controlled by any single entity or government.|
